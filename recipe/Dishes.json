                "crumbled paneer is cooked in tomato and onion based sauce. it is commonly served with roti, pav or bread. the gravy can be prepared with butter for rich flavour. i have used very fewer spices to keep the curry simple and tasty. however, you can add spices like pav bhaji masala to get the street flavour. this is the vegetarian alternative for popular egg bhurji recipe.",

                "raita recipes are very popular in indian cuisine. it is considered as one of the best combinations for pulao and biryani. today i am sharing boondi raita as it is very easy to prepare and completes the thali. i have kept it very simple, however, you can add spices to the curd and also adjust the consistency of raita accordingly.",
